Information about the argument of interest of a structurally recursive function.

The `Expr`s in this data structure expect the `fixedParams` to be in scope, but not the other
parameters of the function. This ensures that this data structure makes sense in the other functions
of a mutually recursive group.

  /-- the name of the recursive function -/
  fnName      : Name
  /-- the fixed prefix of arguments of the function we are trying to justify termination using structural recursion. -/

  /-- position of the argument (counted including fixed prefix) we are recursing on -/

  Return true iff `e` contains an application `recFnName .. t ..` where the term `t` is
  the argument we are trying to recurse on, and it contains loose bound variables.

  We use this test to decide whether we should process a matcher-application as a regular
  application or not. That is, whether we should push the `below` argument should be affected by the matcher or not.
  If `e` does not contain an application of the form `recFnName .. t ..`, then we know
  the recursion doesn't depend on any pattern variable in this matcher.

Lets say we have `n` mutually recursive functions whose recursive arguments are from a group
of `m` mutually inductive data types. This mapping does not have to be one-to-one: for one type
there can be zero, one or more functions. We use the logic in the `FunPacker` modules to combine
the bodies (and motives) of multiple such functions.

Therefore we have to take the `n` functions, group them by their recursive argument's type,
and for each such type, keep track of the order of the functions.

We represent these positions as an `Array (Array Nat)`. We have that

* `positions.size = indInfo.all.length`
* `positions.flatten` is a permutation of `[0:n]`, so each of the `n` functions has exactly one
  position, and each position refers to one of the `n` functions.
* if `k ∈ positions[i]` then the recursive argument of function `k` is has type `indInfo.all[i]`

Let `positions.size = ys.size` and `positions.numIndices = xs.size`. Maps `f` over each `y` in `ys`,
also passing in those elements `xs` that belong to that are those elements of `xs` that belong to
`y` according to `positions`.
